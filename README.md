# Description:
Office Helper is a simple app designed to serve the account department &amp; pension unit of my current employer. The idea came up as a result of the need to revamp the current approach of providing service to other staff as regards accounting. The main idea was to facilitate easy creation of payslips, but i have envisioned a scenario where this basic functionality will metamorphosed into something more fun. This will include amongst other things;

<ol>
  <li>Ability to auto-generate payrolls,</li>
  <li>Creation of payment mandates,</li>
  <li>Calculation of arrears,</li>
  <li>Salary Increments/decrements,</li>
</ol>

# Framework:
The app is basically a web application. Specifically, the tech stack used include;
  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>CodeIgniter 4 PHP Framework </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Tailwind CSS</code> for styling of pages & components
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Javascript (Jquery)</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>MYSQL</code>
    </li>
  </ol>

# O/S & Development Environment
